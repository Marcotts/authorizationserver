- [ ] 7. Configure proper session management (timeouts, concurrent session control)
- [ ] 8. Implement a password policy for user accounts
- [ ] 9. Add security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
- [ ] 10. Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

## Architecture Improvements

- [ ] 11. Replace embedded H2 database with a production-ready database solution
- [ ] 12. Implement a database-backed user store instead of InMemoryUserDetailsManager
- [ ] 13. Externalize all configuration to application.properties or YAML files
- [ ] 14. Implement proper logging with different log levels and log rotation
- [ ] 15. Add health check endpoints for monitoring
- [ ] 16. Implement a proper token revocation mechanism
- [ ] 17. Add support for multiple authorization server instances (session replication, shared database)
- [ ] 18. Implement a proper audit logging system for security events
- [ ] 19. Add metrics collection for performance monitoring
- [ ] 20. Implement a proper cache for token validation

## Code Quality Improvements

- [ ] 21. Add comprehensive JavaDoc to all public classes and methods
- [ ] 22. Implement proper exception handling throughout the codebase
- [ ] 23. Add validation for all input parameters
- [ ] 24. Refactor hardcoded values to constants or configuration properties
- [ ] 25. Implement proper null checks and defensive programming
- [ ] 26. Add logging throughout the codebase for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] 27. Implement proper resource cleanup (try-with-resources, etc.)
- [ ] 28. Fix the malformed Google client ID in application.properties
- [ ] 29. Add proper comments to complex code sections
- [ ] 30. Implement consistent code formatting and style

## Testing Improvements

- [ ] 34. Implement performance tests
- [ ] 35. Add test coverage reporting
- [ ] 36. Implement automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] 37. Add mutation testing to verify test quality
- [ ] 38. Implement contract tests for API endpoints
